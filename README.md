# XRPMaskz-Litepaper
Litepaper of our project.

At XRPMasks, our goal is to create a project that is unique in all 
aspects and without being vague this would mean: our 
distribution, our whitelisting and airdropping effort and the 
number of tokens set aside of our developers, how we plan on 
releasing our token, and also a budget for the future of our 
project.
The effort here is and will remain, to have a token that is mostly 
owned by the community with steps being taken to avoid any 
type of ‘whale’ activity; these characters will normally obtain more 
than their fair share of the token in question and then sell the 
token for profit. This then affects the overall price of our token 
before minting. Notably, this is how projects lose a ton of 
momentum early on and we aim to avoid that. 
Our LLC, is currently being formed and the paperwork has been 
filed, to further legitimize our project and intent to the people 
who choose to partake in this project. 

[ROAD MAP]:
1) Community Building
Discord
Twitter
Instagram
Developer tokens were released before 
trust lines were made, 5 tokens total for 
Devs.
Initial airdrop: 250 XRPM for the first 500 
in Discord – activity tracker used to 
determine active participants, and vet the 
bots.
First 50 people to level 15 in our Discord 
server will be on the first round of 
whitelisting. 125 XRPM for first whitelisting 
period. This also ties into the second 
phase. Price: 55 XRP per XRPM. 2.5 
XRPM per person.
 5,300 XRPM remaining after phase one.

2) Litepaper, Whitelist, Website
LITEPAPER release to social media.
Team met to discuss code to assist in NFT 
generation – will speed up the process, 
some will remain handmade.
Team working on website. TBA
Second round of whitelisting same as first, 
125 XRPM split between 50 people. Price: 
110 XRP per XRPM. 2.5 XRPM per 
person.
Executive decision made by team to run 
with suggestion from community: first 
round white listers will NOT be able to 
partake in the second round. Eligibility 
based on invites to the Discord.
If any tokens remain, they will be split 
evenly between the four sale periods.
 5,000 XRPM remaining after phase two.
After these two phases, we are going to set aside 45 XRPM into a 
wallet that is owned by the LLC, in order to pursue marketing 
ventures for our project, leading into phases three and four.

3) SALE PERIODS
In an attempt to be community-driven, we 
are setting four sale periods.
1,225 or more XRPM per period and buy 
limits set to avoid ‘whale’ activity.
Timeframes of periods TBA.
With this strategy, we ensure the 
community holds all but 155 tokens. 
Marketing (45,) charity (5,) developer (5,) 
and collaboration tokens (100.)
5,400 tokens, ideally with no more than 5 
tokens owned per person is our strategy. 
What’s ideal, does not always happen.
Always remember that we cannot 
guarantee there won’t be any large 
holders. We will simply do what we can, 
and take action steps against large 
holders.
NOTE: the difference between marketing and 
collaborations: 
Collaborations shall take place with other projects, of 
which we have set a limit of 5 XRPM per each individual 
collaboration. 
For example: <Insert project name here> wants to 
collaborate with XRPMaskz, and they want masks of their 
own for their project, we would have five different masks 
to supply to them in their theme and/or themes. These 
collab masks would be paid for.
__
Marketing would be us directly selling masks to any 
entity, project, or person – and/or giving masks to any 
entity, project, or person – in agreeance with us, that 
they’ll shall market our project for a time. 
HOWEVER:
The marketing budget will go towards future endeavors 
for this project, as well as to the LLC for future projects. 
Any budget leftover in collaboration, if not being used for 
such will remain in that budget unless a better use of said 
budget is provided. 

 3) Collaboration & Utility
During sale periods, we will be searching the XRPL and 
Metaverse for opportunities.
Collaboration will be decided by the community, but we 
can only collab if a project agrees to do so with us. 
 

 4) Our Goals for the Future:
A ‘Maskz Only’ Social Club: The Hidden Village – further 
details TBA.
QR Code Sticker Support, for the masks to appear in the 
Metaverse.

 
 The overall inspiration here again is based on community. 
We are going to do our best to encourage people to stick 
around and hold on both good and bad days, should there 
be an issue with us limiting the buy amounts (we are 
doing our research, and will get back to everyone if we 
can or cannot set buy limits for sure.) WE ARE NOT 
FINANCIAL ADVISORS; WE DO NOT GIVE 
FINANCIAL ADVICE. You must understand the risks 
associated with cryptocurrencies before you start 
investing!

 Common questions:
“What is a whitepaper?” | “What are NFTs, really?” 
If you find yourself asking these questions, you are 
implored to research the topic further before investing. 
Validators on social media are a great place to start, for 
the beginner or those who aren’t sure where to find the 
answers. 

 NOTE ON FORWARD-THINKING STATEMENTS:
• “Would,” “could,” “should,” “what-if,” 
“expected to,” “aim,” “target,” “I believe...”
• NO FORWARD-THINKING STATEMENT CAN BE 
DEFINED AS FACT – we cannot determine whether 
or not forward-thinking statements we make, with 
terms above and any other term similar, will ever be 
fact. We make ZERO PROMISES, and all forwardthinking statements shall be categorized as optimism 
as opposed to factual information. 

 This token, $XRPMaskz, will be redeemable 1:1 for a 
randomized NFT that will vary in rarity and appearance. 
Rarities, variations, qualities all to be announced. We have 
discovered a code that’ll assist us in the process of 
generating our NFTs a lot faster and all qualities that can 
be generated for these NFTs, shall be hand-made. 
1:1 in this instance means that one token redeems for one 
minted NFT. Your unique piece of art is what you want to 
hold your token for! 
There will be (as of right now) 10 different mask styles 
with each mask in that set style collection being 
individualized and unique; even though you and another 
person have the same mask SHAPE, the chances are slim 
that you and another person have more than 1 of any 
similar characteristics, but if we add enough there will be 
no chance of having duplicate characteristics. 
_______________________________________________
As we continue along with our project, per 
community decisions and potentially altered 
decisions with marketing and collaborations, this 
paper currently remains a lite paper. 
As we continue to confirm details, and add 
more information, we will turn this into the 
complete whitepaper. We are not far off, just 
expecting updates to the things aforementioned.
